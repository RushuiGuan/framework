# .NET configuration Setup

.NET supports loading configuration from various sources such as files, environment variables, and command line parameters. 


## Configuration using appsettings.json config file
Configurations are usually the second things to setup when building a host.  The first thing to setup should be [logging](../../logging/Albatross.Logging/).  


## Command Line config setup
While configuration files and environment variables are often part of the standard config setup in any application.  Reading config from command line parser is less common and should be used sparsely.
