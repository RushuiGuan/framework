# Albatross.CommandLine.CodeGen
A companion code generator used by the [Albatross.CommandLine](../Albatross.CommandLine/) library.

## Features
As a development dependency of [Albatross.CommandLine](../Albatross.CommandLine/) library, codegen will be referenced automatically as a PrivateAssets when the reference for [Albatross.CommandLine](../Albatross.CommandLine/) is added to a project.  The code generator looks for options classes those are annotated with the [Albatross.CommandLine.VerbAttribute](../Albatross.CommandLine/VerbAttribute.cs) and genenerate the appropriate command classes.  In the example below, the class `TestOptions`, `TestCommandHandler` and the first `TestCommand` class are created manually and the second `TestCommand` class is generated.  

* The command is created as a partial class which allows user to add additional functionalities.  To customize a command, create a partial command class of the same name with the interface [Albatross.CommandLine.IRequireInitialization](../Albatross.CommandLine/IRequireInitialization.cs).  
* Nullable property are declared as optional and vice vesa.  However requirement can be overwritten using the [Albatross.CommandLine.OptionAttribute](../Albatross.CommandLine/OptionAttribute.cs) as shown in the `Value` property in the example.
* Option alias can be created using the [Albatross.CommandLine.OptionAttribute](../Albatross.CommandLine/OptionAttribute.cs).  Aliases are prefixed with a single dash ('-') if the dash has not been prefixed already.

```csharp
[Verb("test", typeof(TestCommandHandler), Description = "A test command")]
public record class TestOptions {
	// required since its type is not nullable
	public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
	// not required since its type is nullable
	public string? Description { get; set; }
	// not required since the default behavior is overwritten by the Option attribute
	[Option("v", "value", Required = false, Description = "An integer value")]
	public int Value { get; set; }
}
// implement your command handler logic here
public class TestCommandHandler : ICommandHandler {
	...
}
public partial class TestCommand : IRequireInitialization {
	// this method will be call right after object construction
	public void Init() {
		// customize your command here
		...
	}
}
public sealed partial class TestCommand : Command {
	public TestCommand() : base("test", "A test command") {
		this.Option_Name = new Option<string>("--name", null) {
			IsRequired = true
		};
		this.AddOption(Option_Name);
		this.Option_Description = new Option<string?>("--description", null);
		this.AddOption(Option_Description);
		this.Option_Value = new Option<int>("--value", "An integer value");
		Option_Value.AddAlias("-v");
		this.AddOption(Option_Value);
	}

	public Option<string> Option_Name { get; }
	public Option<string?> Option_Description { get; }
	public Option<int> Option_Value { get; }
}
```
The second part of the code generator will create the service registration and option binding code.  The `RegisterCommands` method should be invoked by service registration code in the Setup class.  `AddCommands` method is part of the bootstrap code in `program.cs` file.  See [Albatross.CommandLine](../Albatross.CommandLine/README.md) for details.
```csharp
public static class RegistrationExtensions
	{
		public static IServiceCollection RegisterCommands(this IServiceCollection services) {
			services.AddKeyedScoped<ICommandHandler, TestCommandHandler>("test");
			services.AddOptions<TestOptions>().BindCommandLine();
			return services;
		}

		public static Setup AddCommands(this Setup setup) {
			setup.AddCommand<TestCommand>();
			return setup;
		}
	}
